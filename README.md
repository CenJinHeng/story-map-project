# Instructions of Jinheng's story map project

## Introduction
The US Virgin Islands (USVI), known for its vibrant culture and attractive landscape, relies heavily on tourism as its economic pillar; however, its famous cultural assets and natural treasures are at risk of both flooding and sea level rise. My story map shows areas at high flooding risks, most of which are located in coastal areas and river sides. For a more resilient development, actions must be taken. These maps clearly show the affected areas on islands, which can be used to educate residents, stakeholders, and business owners to support the costal management plan.
