        <h1>US Virgin Islands Flooding Hazard</h1>
        <p>The US Virgin Islands (USVI), located in the Caribbean, consist of three main islands, St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix. Known for their stunning scenery and vibrant culture, the islands rely heavily on tourism as their primary economic driver. However, flooding and sea level rise are increasingly threatening this vital industry. Many of the region’s hotels, beaches, and historic districts are situated along the coast, making them highly vulnerable to natural disasters. The devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 highlighted this risk, with damages estimated at $11 billion for recovery.
Understanding flooding hazards is therefore critical for the islands’ long-term economic resilience. The following maps illustrate which areas are most at risk under a 100-year flood scenario.</p>
        <p class="map-note"> In the following maps, the areas highlighted in <span class="flood-color">blue</span> represent regions at risk of flooding. </p>

        <h1>St. Thomas</h1>
        <p>St. Thomas is the gateway to the US Virgin Islands, with the main cruise ship port and airport. Thousands of visitors arrive here to explore the island, especially the historic town of Charlotte Amalie. However, both the airport and downtown are highly exposed to flooding</p>

        <h2>St. John</h2>
        <p>St. John is home to the Virgin Islands National Park, protecting much of the island’s forests, beaches, and coral reefs. While it attracts thousands of visitors each year, key areas like Cruz Bay and Coral Bay remain highly vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise, threatening both local communities and the park’s natural treasures.</p>

        <h2>St. Croix</h2>
        <p>St. Croix is the largest of the US Virgin Islands and has historically been a hub for agriculture and industry. Today it remains vital for food production and manufacturing, while also hosting cultural landmarks in Christiansted and Frederiksted. However, much of its coastal land—including industrial zones and farmland—faces high flooding risk, threatening both livelihoods and infrastructure.</p>
